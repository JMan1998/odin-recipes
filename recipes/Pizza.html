    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough (1 day in advance recommended): In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand
            for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in salt and olive oil. Gradually add flour, mixing until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a clean bowl, place dough in it, turning to coat. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for
            18-24 hours. (For same-day use, let rise at room temperature for 1.5-2 hours until doubled).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a bowl, crush tomatoes by hand. Stir in minced garlic (if using), oregano, and salt.
            Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat Oven and Pizza Stone/Steel: Place a pizza stone or steel on the middle rack of your oven. Preheat
            oven to its highest setting (250-260°C or Gas Mark 9-10) for at least 45-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape the Dough: On a lightly floured surface (semolina or "00" flour works best), gently stretch or press
            one dough ball into a thin, 25-30cm circle. Try to keep the edges slightly thicker for the crust.</li>
        <li>Assemble Pizza: Carefully transfer the dough to a pizza peel lightly dusted with semolina or flour.</li>
        <li>Spread about half of the sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a 1cm border.</li>
        <li>Scatter half of the fresh mozzarella and a sprinkle of Pecorino/Parmesan over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake: Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone/steel in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 5-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots, and the cheese is bubbly and
            lightly browned. Baking time will vary greatly by oven temperature.</li>
        <li>Finish and Serve: Carefully remove the pizza from the oven using the peel. Garnish with fresh basil leaves
            and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve immediately. Repeat for the second pizza.</li>
