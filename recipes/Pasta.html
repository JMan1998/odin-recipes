    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g pasta (e.g., spaghetti, linguini, fusilli)</li>
        <li>200g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>50g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated (plus more for serving)</li>
        <li>Salt for pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Pesto (Homemade - or use 180g jarred pesto):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>60g fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>30g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>30g pine nuts</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook according to
            package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Prepare Homemade Pesto (if not using jarred): While the pasta cooks, combine basil, Parmesan, pine nuts, and
            garlic in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Gradually drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil
            while pulsing until a smooth sauce forms. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (If using jarred pesto, skip
            this step).</li>
        <li>Combine and Serve: Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about 100ml of the pasta cooking water, then drain the
            rest. Return the drained pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the pesto (homemade or jarred) to the warm pasta. Toss well to coat.</li>
        <li>If the sauce seems too thick, add a little reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches
            your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Stir in the halved cherry tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with extra grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
