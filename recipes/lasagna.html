    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce (Ragù): Heat olive oil in a large pot or deep frying pan over medium heat. Add the
            chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until
            fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the minced beef to the pot. Break it up with a spoon and cook until browned on all sides. Drain any
            excess fat.</li>
        <li>Pour in the red wine (if using) and simmer for 5 minutes, allowing the alcohol to evaporate. Stir in the
            crushed tomatoes and dried oregano. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it
            cook for at least 30-45 minutes (or longer for deeper flavour), stirring occasionally. Season with salt and
            pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Make the Béchamel Sauce: While the ragù simmers, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the
            flour and whisk constantly for 1-2 minutes to form a smooth paste (roux).</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the warm milk, a little at a time, ensuring each addition is fully incorporated before
            adding more, to prevent lumps. Continue whisking until the sauce thickens to a smooth, creamy consistency.
            Season with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan/Gas Mark 4).</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a large ovenproof dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna sheets over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the pasta sheets, followed by a layer of meat sauce, and then a
            sprinkle of shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process: pasta, béchamel, meat sauce, mozzarella, until all ingredients are used, ending
            with a final layer of pasta, béchamel, and a generous topping of mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the dish loosely with foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbling, and the
            pasta is tender.</li>
        <li>Rest: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving to allow it to set and make slicing easier.</li>
    </ol>
