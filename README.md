# Odin Recipes

## Project Description

This project is a simple recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. It serves as a practical exercise to demonstrate fundamental web development skills using HTML.

The website will feature a main index page that links to several different recipe pages, each detailing ingredients and instructions for a specific dish.

## Skills Demonstrated

Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in:

* **HTML Structure:** Correctly structuring web pages using various HTML elements (e.g., headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images).
* **Semantic HTML:** Using appropriate semantic tags to give meaning to content.
* **Hyperlinking:** Navigating between different HTML pages within the same website using relative links.
* **Basic Web Page Creation:** The end-to-end process of creating and linking multiple static HTML documents.
* **Git & GitHub Workflow:**
    * Initializing and cloning a Git repository.
    * Tracking changes with `git status` and `git add`.
    * Saving progress with `git commit` using clear, descriptive messages.
    * Pushing local changes to a remote GitHub repository.
